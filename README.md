# Description

This is a place to find a step by step guides on how to become a software developer.

If you know nothing(and I mean literally nothing) and want to become a software developer you are in the right place. Fear not, the path to begin is not that complicated!

The main idea here is to give the very first guidence and direction to onboard people in the world of software development. The target of each guide is to help a person to get the very minimal skill set to land a job as a junior software developer as soon as possible. Please remember, that this is a bare minimum and does not provide you with extencive guide on how to become a specialist, you will have to figure it out yourself.

For everything that you actually need to learn there will be a "Good Enough Target" goal, after which you can concider yourself as knowing basics and after reaching one you should move on to the next one.

The key point here is to not get sinked into the research loop and tutorial hell and move quickly from one GET goal to another while getting grasp of the topic. You should move on to the next GET goal ONLY when you feel confident that you can replicate the current one one more time and you understand what was in the guide.

Again, you should not spend time memorizing each command as this is worthless. Focus on the concept and the steps. If you feel that you understand the concept and can describe it, move on.

## Contribution

I would love to see experienced people sharing their opinions and suggesting improvements. But, please keep in mind, that the main goal is not be extensive, but to make a person be able to land a job or at the very least close to that.

Every guide should be written in a way that expects nothing from a person following it, except of what is stated in the [Basics](./guides/basics.md) or "General" guide of the particular section. The rule of thumb - "Do not implicitly assume anything". Everything required should be explicitely listed in the guide.

My personal goal for this project is to make a non-opinionated description for people who just want to start and not sink into the abyss of myriads of guides... by making another guide

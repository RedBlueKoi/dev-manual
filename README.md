# Description

This is a place to find a step by step guides on how to become a software developer.

If you know nothing(and I mean literally nothing) and want to become a software developer you are in the right place. Fear not, the path to begin is not that complicated!

The main idea here is to give the very first guidence and direction to onboard people in the world of software development. The target of each guide is to help a person to get the very minimal skill set to land a job as a junior software developer as soon as possible. Please remember, that is a bare minimum and does not provide you with extencive guide on how to become a specialist, you will have to figure it out yourself.

I would love to see experienced people sharing their opinions and suggesting improvements. But, please keep in mind, that the main goal is not be extencive, but to make a person be able to land a job or at the very least close to that.

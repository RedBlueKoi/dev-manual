# Basics

First of all, welcome!

This is a section for all the skills and tools that will most likely be required or expected from you to know. All of them are not that complicated. You might be confused a bit, if you are coming from the very clean base, but you can expect to go through very quickly. One thing tho - please follow the steps in the exact order. If you are pretty confident that you already know the step you are in, feel free to jump to the next one.

Let's clear out a quick question - what's up with different OS. A lot of developers using Mac OS for many reasons. Other prefer one of the multiple flavours of Linux. Both options are good. However, if you are running Windows, you can do almost everything in the guides, but your life may be a bit difficult and setting up the environment may require some tinkering.

Below you can find the list of things that would most likely be applicable no matter what field you want to join. These tools are used by almost any developer.

# Information search

The main skill you will have to obtain to become a software developer is an ability to quickly find a piece of information to solve a problem. This is very crucial and the exact reason you don't need a fancy courses or bootcamps. You don't need to memorize every word in the language, but you need to know how to quickly and efficiently find what you need.

A developer is a master google search user.

Besides the obvious usage of \*insert your favourite search engine name\* there are a lot of websites to help you out. For example one of the most common places are [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com). There are more websites with information more specific to sertain situations, but they would be listed in the related sections of the guide.

Naturally, the skill to "ask google" for a correct answer will come with experience, but you need to get the said experience first. The good idea would be whenever you feel stuck on something to timebox 30mins just on googling. Try to find the solution yourself first. If you are a beginner there is a good chance that your question was asked and most certainly answered by someone else somewhere. You just need to find it. By doing this, you will learn how to search for information, find places where you can find more information on the topic and a lot of other things.

If you haven't found a solution in 30mins you always can post a new question on SO or let's say Reddit.
